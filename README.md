Dubai Rental Market Analytics Project — Power BI, Excel, Python
📊 Just added a new project to my analytics portfolio!

I built a Dubai Rental Market Analytics Suite from scratch as a hands-on way to sharpen my Power BI and Excel skills.

🔧 What I practiced:

• Python — dataset generation, pandas, CSV export
• Power BI — data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards
• Excel — AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS, XLOOKUP, PMT, dynamic arrays, investment calculator
• Data storytelling — turning raw numbers into actionable insights

📁 Project deliverables:
— Power BI report with 6 visuals + slicers
— Excel workbook (6 sheets, 48 formulas, 0 errors ✅)
— Professional Word insight report (9 sections)

The dataset is a realistic 500-property sample modeled on Dubai market benchmarks from DLD and Property Finder public reports.

Building projects like this — even with sample data — is how I'm bridging the gap between learning and real-world analytics work.

Open to feedback from data professionals! 🙌
